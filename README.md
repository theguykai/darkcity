# Dark City Productions Portfolio Page

This page was designed with React and TailwindCSS for the front end, and uses NodeJS and Express for the backend (the contact form).

### See it here - [https://www.darkcityproductions.com.au/](https://www.darkcityproductions.com.au/)

This is my first full stack page built with React, Tailwind, Node and Express.

The purpose of this project came about from wanting to have a webpage under my portfolio, and wanted to update my friend's Wix page he created 7 years prior.

Whilst this is only my first uploaded page, I am still actively working on it with my friend, to get current content, and to improve on SEO skills.
