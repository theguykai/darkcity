# Dark City Productions Portfolio Page

This page was designed with React and TailwindCSS for the front end, and uses NodeJS and Express for the backend (the contact form).

### See it here - [https://www.darkcityproductions.com.au/](https://www.darkcityproductions.com.au/)

This is my first full stack page built with React, Tailwind, Node and Express.
I created it as my friend's portfolio page is old, and could use with a touch up - see it here - https://www.darkcityproductions.com.au
It took me about 3 days to complete in total, as I had never used Tailwind, Node or Express before.

### To run the page locally once cloned, run "npm start" when inside the darkcity folder in a terminal, and then run "node server.js" in a separate terminal for the backend to work.

## The frontend uses localhost:3000 and the backend uses localhost:5000

#### In future projects, I have learnt to create frontend and backend folders, and have separate package.json files.
