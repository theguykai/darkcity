# Dark City Productions Portfolio Page

This is my first ever webpage that I designed with React and TailwindCSS for the front end, and used NodeJS and Express for the backend (the contact form).

### See it here - [https://www.darkcityproductions.com.au/](https://www.darkcityproductions.com.au/)

The purpose of this project came about from wanting to have a webpage under my portfolio, and wanted to update my friend's Wix page he created 7 years prior.
